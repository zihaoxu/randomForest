# randomForestBLB

The implementation of the randomForest package using BLB (Bags of little Bootstraps), a resampling method devised by Kleiner et al. in "A Scalable Bootstrap for Massive Data" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5016).

The purpose and significance of this project is to adapt the random forest algorithm to a Big Data setting using a paralleled and distributed architecture. Some of the results can be found in the Plot folder under the "BLB-RF-Sim" repository.

This project is led by Zihao Xu, Pomona College'19, and Dr. Johanna Hardin. It is an ongoing project.
